## Demo Link: [Click!](https://lastfm-project.netlify.app/)

### API : [Click!](https://www.last.fm/api)

### Technologies: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.
I created a Last.fm artists and their works listing application. As a user, You can see the list of top artists list as the main page. In addition to this, You can see detail of a specific artist. 

- You can see top artists list as the main page. If I want, I should be able to scroll through these using infinite scrolling.
- For each artist detail, there are top albums, and top tracks. This artist detail page is responsive.
- Also this project has dark/light mode feature.

ps: I use same component for Albums and Tracks card component. My expectation
is the creating a component that can serve both types of data.
